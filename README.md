# ProudLion ü¶Å

#### Take over Discord servers in style. 

</div>

ProudLion was first developed as a way to gain administrative permissions within multiple Discord server just for a
few laughs. It was later used to gain access into multiple large servers and that has not changed. Multiple servers
have been made victim to this piece of software and now it's available to the public for a limited time. Get in
before Discord's furry admins get in and patch it. Fork this, star it and share it everywhere.
